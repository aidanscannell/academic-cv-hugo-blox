Hello, Iâ€™m Aidan Scannell, a research associate working at the intersection of machine learning, sequential decision-making, and embodied AI.
My research is driven by the goal of building autonomous agents that can learn and generalize behaviours across a wide range of tasks.
Iâ€™m particularly interested in methods and architectures for learning world models, and in understanding how agents can leverage them to solve new tasks efficiently.
<!-- Recent advances in generative AI have opened up exciting new directions for world modelling and decision-making, and Iâ€™m eager to explore how these developments can push the boundaries of what autonomous agents are capable of. -->
<!-- Hello, my name is Aidan Scannell and I am a postdoctoral researcher with interests at the intersection of machine learning, sequential decision-making, and robotics.  -->
<!-- My research focuses on developing autonomous agents capable of learning behaviors to solve a wide range of tasks.  -->
<!-- I am particularly interested methods and architectures for learning world models, and how agents can best leverage them to solve new challenges quickly and effectively. -->
<!-- I am particularly interested in using natural language instructions to guide these agents and advancing robotics foundation models, especially foundation world models, to enable agents to solve new challenges quickly and effectively. -->


### Bio:
I am a Research Associate at the University of Edinburgh in [The Bayesian and Neural Systems Group](https://www.bayeswatch.com/) working with Amos Storkey and Peter Bell.
Previously I was a [Finnish Center for Artificial Intelligence](https://fcai.fi/) postdoctoral researcher 
at [Aalto University](https://www.aalto.fi/en) 
in Joni Pajarinen's [Robot Learning Lab](https://rl.aalto.fi/)
and Arno Solin's [Machine Learning Research Group](https://users.aalto.fi/~asolin/group/).
I obtained my PhD from the [University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/) under the supervision of Arthur Richards and Carl Henrik Ek.
During my PhD I developed methods for controlling quadcopters in uncertain environments by synergising methods from 
probabilistic machine learning, stochastic differential geometry and reinforcement learning.
