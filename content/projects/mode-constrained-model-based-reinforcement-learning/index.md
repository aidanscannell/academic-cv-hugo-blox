title: "Mode-Constrained Exploration for Model-Based Reinforcement Learning"
summary: "This work presents a learning-based control method for navigating to a target state in unknown, or partially unknown, multimodal dynamical systems. In particular, it develops a model-based reinforcement learning algorithm that can remain in a desired dynamics mode with high probability. For example, if some of the dynamics modes are believed to be inoperable."
